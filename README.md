**Project Details:**


**Introduction-** Nowadays, we have found that many students have trouble for feel shy to talk to their professors, seniors, or even to their classmates. This can also be in the other way round, the students are not able to express their thoughts or ideas to the professor because of the generation gap so the only way to get things done is to start communicating with the seniors, as the seniors have the latest experience and can get their juniors with new ideas but they are busy with their career. So here we have come with the new idea

**Platfrom-** Our website aims to end the communication barriers between juniors especially 1st year and senior. The website will be an interconnected social platform between juniors and seniors where juniors can ask seniors all kinds of questions and queries related to their field and profession of interest. Junior's generally either are afraid to ask seniors about these choices or just don't interact enough with them. Our objective is to create a social platform where juniors will be freely able to interact with seniors about questions related to general studies professional studies and so much more. This interaction will create a sophisticated interconnection standard. Only a few selected seniors will be able to answer these queries but all the juniors will be able to ask about their problems. We believe that this website will create a learning environment that will enhance the students the knowledge and the ability to grow exponentially in their fields.

**Functioning-** The website will act as a hub where students need to register themselves. during the registration process, students need to fill in all the academic details including college name department year, etc. Once the student is in they will be redirected to their college's home page with their department and they can start asking questions and doubts. as mentioned above only a few selected seniors will be able to answer those queries as not to create confusion disturbance and chaos. The seniors will be rewarded with a points/upvotes reward system which they will receive benefits in the final year. Students from any year can ask the questions but they will be replied to by a senior/expert only.
